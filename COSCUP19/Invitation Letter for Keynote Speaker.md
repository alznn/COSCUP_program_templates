### About COSCUP
COSCUP(https://coscup.org/2019/en) is an annual conference held by Taiwanese Open source community participants since 2006. COSCUP's aim is to provide a platform to connect Open Source coders, users, and promoters, and promote FLOSS with the annual conference. The conference is free to attend and all the staffs are volunteers. 

We had **more than 1600 attendees** last year, and we believe this year will be more, it is the biggest open source gathering in Taiwan, and the attendees are mostly developers, along with some power users and FLOSS promoters and lovers.
