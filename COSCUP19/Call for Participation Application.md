## Community Room
Community Rooms are assigned to self-organizing groups to work, share, and discuss issues around an open-source-related topic. The application should be submitted before March 9th.

* You can decide the content and format in your Community Room.
* You can decide the duration of each section and the whole schedule in your Community Room.

### Key dates
* March 9th: Deadline for Community Room application
* March 12th: Accepted Community Room announced on blog.coscup.org will be published on April 1st, with CfP.
* March 26th: Community Room coordinators provide information of Call for Proposal

* May 6th: Deadline for Call for Proposal
* Mid-May: Community Room coordinators provide the complete schedule
* Early June: Full schedule published on COSCUP.org (TBC)
* Augest 17-18 at Taipei: COSCUP 2019

### Application rules
#### Schedule
We do not plan for rooms to be empty during the event. By applying for a Community Room you are making a commitment to fill the schedule.

Community Room coordinators must provide a complete schedule to the program team by mid-May. (A template will be provided.)

Community Room schedules should contain about 6 hours of content, depending on the availability. Duration of each slot can be decided by you, breaks are nice to have, but not a requirement.

If you don’t think you can fill the schedule, please try to join up with another project and submit a joint application, or indicate on the submission form that you are requesting only half-a-day and would like COSCUP to try to pair you up with another similar request for half-a-day.

#### Call for (talk) proposals
Once your application has been accepted, you will need to provide information about things that should be included in the proposal submissions before March 26th. All the talk proposals should be submitted via COSCUP’s official CfP form.

As usual, we will record most (/all, if possible) of the talks, and the recordings will be published under the CC-BY-SA 4.0 license. If, exceptionally, there is a reason why any particular speaker or discussion should not be streamed or recorded, you must seek our agreement before including this in your schedule as such permission is unlikely to be granted.

#### Coordinators / Volunteers
Please include the contact information of 2 community members on the application as the coordinators. The coordinators will be the main contact people, and (at least) one of the coordinators should be present in the Community Room during your slots.

Also, start from this year, you will need to find volunteers in your community to take photos of speakers / keep the video cam rolling. If your volunteers need tickets of COSCUP, they will need to register by themselves or apply for one via Open Source Contributor program.

The booth must be manned anytime during the conference. Please ensure your goods and valuables during and prior to the conference, COSCUP is not responsible for any losses during the event.

You will need to get approval from COSCUP for any vocal or sound effects playing or food providing within the exhibition areas.

自訂休息時間：各社群可以決定是否有休息時間，或是連番上陣。

### 申請規則
#### 議程表內容
歷年來 COSCUP 演講時間皆供不應求，因此我們不希望講堂刻意留空。申請此案代表您承諾將填滿所配發的議程時間。每段社群議程之配發時間約當 6 小時左右，確定的時段將依據申請狀況略有調整，容後公佈。排設議程時，每段議程時間長短、是否有休息時間等，由社群自行決定。

社群議程的協調人需在五月中以前將完整分配時間的議程表提供予COSCUP 議程組以利公布及製作印刷品。（將有範本可供填寫）

如果您沒有信心稿件能填滿全天議程，請與其他社群共同申請，或在申請書上註明希望 COSCUP 協助配對，COSCUP 會盡力而為但無法保證。

#### 議題投稿
通過申請後，您需要在 3 月 26 日前提供徵稿時所需的資訊（例如希望有哪類稿件、有沒有特殊欄位等等），COSCUP 將統整後一併發佈徵稿消息及表單。所有稿件皆須透過 COSCUP 的表單填寫（即使是您自行邀請的亦同）。

COSCUP 將盡可能為所有演講錄影，這些影片將在會後以創用 CC 姓名標示-相同方式分享 4.0 版公開釋出。如果特定講者要求不可錄影或直播，請謹慎考慮是否收納，並徵得 COSCUP 議程組同意後方可收入議程軌。

#### 協調人與必備工作人員
請在申請時填上兩位社群成員的姓名與聯絡方式，作為此社群在大會期間議程的協調人。在申請通過後，此兩位將成為大會主要的聯絡窗口。在社群議程進行時，至少要有一位協調人留在講堂，負責該時段的相關行政事宜。

自今年起，COSCUP 的攝影組將不再擔保為每位講者拍攝照片，如有需求請社群自行派員協助拍攝；又，申請社群必須協助確保講廳內的錄影器材持續運作、正確錄製影片。如果前述工作需要額外工作人員，請該員預先藉由開源貢獻者方案等方式申請COSCUP票券。
