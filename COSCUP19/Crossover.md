Crossover
====


There are a few things we have done for COSCUP x HKOSCon crossover. I'm trying to list them here to help other groups join this program:

## 1. Create your budget

You will need to decide how much you want to spend on this program, includes but not limited to travel sponsor for speakers & your staff. 

Note that it's not necessary to sponsor the full cost of every speaker.

COSCUP decide to cover 80% of the cost, or TWD 11500, for each speaker from Taiwan to HKOSCon. We are still trying to figure out the number for other partner conferences.

## 2. Prepare the rules for travel sponsor

We wrote a document like this https://hackmd.io/s/H1XAxHQ74, which contains:

* How much (at most) the sponsoring is
* Only one speaker of each session will get the sponsoring.
* Important dates of the whole sponsoring process.

## 3. Prepare the CfP of the special track

We confirmed things below with HKOSCon before the CfP open:

* Is there an official event or dinner party "before" the conference? If so, we will need to arrive earlier.
* When exactly will the special track arrange? -> Saturday, 10:00-17:30.
* What is the general format of talk in HKOSCon? -> 30 minutes for a session, with a 10 minutes break between each session.
* When we should submit our finalists to HKOSCon 

Also, HKOSCon sends us a CfP template so we can easily adapt it and create our own for the special track.

## 4. After CfP opened

* Promote the CfP. We wrote a post for this: https://blog.coscup.org/2019/01/hkosconcoscup.html
* Check how many submissions regularly, to see if we need to give it a push.
* We even planned plan B and C, just in case we don't have enough submissions: a 3hr workshop, a panel for speakers to discuss OSS in Taiwan

## 5. Decide the finalists 

* And contact them to make sure that they are committed to present.
* Prepare the track information and submit to HKOSCon
* Coordinating with HKOSCon to publish the result: https://blog.coscup.org/2019/03/hkoscon-2019-coscup-special-track.html
* We had an agreement with HKOSCon that they will send out the official Thank-you-letter for ones who failed to enter the finalists.


## 6. Booking flights and accommodations

* We worked with a travel agent to help speakers and our own crew to book flights and accommodations for HKOSCon.
* The partner travel agent is actually operated by a long-time OSS contributor, so things go really smooth.
* It's not necessary to help people doing this -- they can help themselves. If we don't, things will be a lot easier. But still, we are trying to provide a better service to ensure the program success.

## 7. Other promotion

* Both COSCUP & HKOSCon wrote a few posts of the crossover to promote the program. Most of the post have been checked by each other before posting.

目前我們在 HKOSCon 合作案裡做了些事，我打算列出來讓後續的合作案有個參考：


## 開立預算

要決定你打算為此花多少錢，包括講者跟工作人員的旅費補助等等。我們不見得必須全額補助，COSCUP 在這次與 HKOSCon 的合作案就決定只補助 80%（或台幣 11500）旅費。

其他合作夥伴的案子裡，可能這個數字還會有所變動。

## 撰寫旅費補助申請辦法

請參考 https://hackmd.io/s/H1XAxHQ74

## 準備特別軌的徵稿消息

在「COSCUP 特別軌」的 CfP 發佈前，我們向 HKOSCon 確認過以下事項：

* 是否有會前活動？關係到要訂幾點的機票。
* 我們的議程軌會安排在何時：後來確定是週六 10:00-17:30
* HKOSCon 慣用的議程型態：每節 30 分鐘，兩節之間有 10 分鐘休息時間。這代表我們大概可以收 8-10 個。
* 何時要給 HKOSCon 最後名單與資料？

HKOSCon 也提供了 CfP 的範本給我們，讓我們改一改就可以上。

## CfP 發布後

* 宣傳： https://blog.coscup.org/2019/01/hkosconcoscup.html
* 常常檢查多少人投稿了，適時安排宣傳
* 我們還有另外規劃「萬一稿件量不夠時」的備案，例如 workshop、panel 那類的。還好最後是沒用到

## 決定入選者

* 並且，也要聯絡他們，確定他們的出席意願
* 整理議程軌跟講者資料，送交 HKOSCon
* 跟 HKOSCon 協調議程表的公佈時間： https://blog.coscup.org/2019/03/hkoscon-2019-coscup-special-track.html
* 我們跟 HKOSCon 協商過，未入選者的感謝函由 HKOSCon 發送。


## 代為訂購機票、旅館

* 今年我們找了合作旅行社一起協助講者及 COSCUP 的團員訂購機票、住宿
* 合作旅行社的老闆（之一）是開源軟體長期貢獻者，大家彼此互信，所以各種需求的彈性跟速度都很快
* 其實不見得要做這件事，也可以叫大家自己辦理，但我們希望提高萬事的成功率所以就盡量把服務做滿。



## 其他：宣傳協調

* HKOSCon 跟 COSCUP 各自針對這次合作發了幾篇宣傳文到 Blog / FB / Twitter，這些文大多有彼此預告過。
