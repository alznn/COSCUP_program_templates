「COSCUP 特別軌」將於 HKOSCon 的第二天，也就是 2019/06/15 舉辦，[相關票券事宜請緊盯 HKOSCon 官網](https://hkoscon.org/2019)。以下所有時間順序在大會前或有變動，以 HKOSCon 網站公佈為準。

以下是本次入選的講題、講者及內容：

## Formal Verification on Smart Contract
10:00-10:30
(陳奕熹)

For ethereum, 2016 might be a tough year, the DAO has been stolen 3.6 million ETH, equivalent of $70 million at that time, due to improper contract design. As a result, more and more automatic verification tool for smart contract come out to prevent potentially huge financial loss.

Today, we will be looking at how formal verification tools work on smart contract, how can we use mathematical proof to ensure the quality of program.


## DApp Game - Blockchain random number generation method and implementation
10:40-11:10
(Huang Shih Chin(Xixi))

When users realized that the "application on the ICO was more important than the "token", the virtual currency began to decline in June 2018, prompting users in the market to pay attention to the development of the tokens. The development of DApp began to expand. The DApp industry recorded a turnover of 33.6 billion RMB in 2018. Almost 90% of the turnover comes from DApp games.

Because DApp game is built on the blockchain, it greatly restricts the gameplay. Currently, the common DApp games are: playing cards and dice.

This topic will introduce the DApp Gaming random number generation method on the market and analyze its advantages and disadvantages. And lead the audience together to implement the simple "solidity" version.


## Decentralized data marketplace based on Distributed Ledgers
11:20-11:50
(林京樺 (Jing-Hua Lin), 陳冠廷 (Kuan-Ting Chen))

The value of data is not a new thing, whether in business or in warfare.

Either the goal of precision marketing or the material collection for machine learning, their intentions can be shorten into one word: data, the oil in the digital era.

Not surprisingly, data storage and marketplace turn into new challenges.In this session, we'll introduce an innovative type of data marketplace platform with distributed legder technology (DLT) to transform data into profits with better trust basic.



## A Talk about OSS Communities in Taiwan
12:10-12:40
We will have a short talk about the OSS communities in Taiwan. This talk will be presented by COSCUP staff and the topic and speaker is Singing Li.


## A muggle promote Open Source pathways. Take COSCUP sponsorship team for example.
12:50-13:20
(Ying-Hsin Hsu)

The normal people who doesn't coding could promote Open Source projects or campaigns. We can do my best. People will know what is Open Source and its spirit by the public relation plan. Companies will know how to use Open Source upgrading their software by sponsor Open Source campaigns.


## Plant Identification System with AI + AR
14:20-14:50
(Denken Chen, Wang Fumin, Nandalu)

A smart flower atlas, built on open source image recognition systems, powered by advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Augmented Reality (AR) technologies.

We’ve done real-time identification mobile apps on iOS and Android, without ever taking a picture. We continue to collaborate with specialists to improve the system.

This project won 2018 g0v Civic Tech Grant. Landing page: https://plant-tw.github.io


## Status-quo of TensorFlow Lite on
15:00-15:30
(Koan-Sin Tan)

AI, or more precisely neural network-based machine learning, is getting popular on edge devices. In this talk I'll review TensorFlow Lite + Android NN, the most popular open source NN frameworks on Android, and share my experience of using some recently new features of TFLite, such as TFLite GPU delegate.


## Build a minimal DBMS from scratch by Rust
15:40-16:10
(Liu, An-Chi)

I will introduce to Rust, including the principles, the traits, and the current state of the Rust community. After that, I am going to talk about how to build a minimal DBMS from scratch - the StellarSQL project. In this talk, the following is covered. What is a DBMS? What is the architecture of the DBMS? What is the progress in developing the project? What are the existed resources in the community that I use for the developing? The speech would manifest that developing a small DBMS is fascinating and Rust is cool and powerful.


## Decentralized Bare-Metal Operating System Provisioning
16:30-17:00
(Yu-Chiang Huang 黃宇強)

The EZIO Project proposes a reasonably efficient P2P soultion to deploy bare-metal operating system based on open source software technologies, such as libtorrent-rasterbar and CloneZilla. In this talk, we will discuss the difficult situation of bare-metal deployment in HPC or Cloud, and the performance, reliability and flexibility improvements on existing technologies, such as CloneZilla Multicast Mode.

EZIO has integrated in CloneZilla to provide 1-to-many bare-metal system provisioning on-the-fly, and tested successfully in HPC.



## Homemade scientific clusters
17:10-17:40
(Taihsiang Ho)

As a great glue language, Python could (definitely) orchestrate many modern and powerful tools to build a scientific cluster. This talk will illustrate one of the real world examples, which is a cluster built and running on top of LXD/LXC/KVM/MaaS/public clouds so you may thus be a amateur CFD (computational fluid dynamics) or physics researcher.
